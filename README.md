## üìù Project Overview

MemoSynth-Lite is a modular, multi-store memory system for LLM agents.  
It enables agents to remember, retrieve, and summarize information over time‚Äîjust like a human memory.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Store and search memories semantically (Qdrant)
- Track memory evolution and conflicts (DuckDB)
- Extract and relate entities and events (Neo4j)
- Summarize, compare, and resolve memory conflicts using LLMs

**Motivation:**  
Modern LLM agents need a robust, multi-modal memory system to reason, plan, and act over long time horizons. MemoSynth-Lite is designed to be simple, extensible, and as a foundation for more advanced AI projects on similar lines.

## üöÄ Features

- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve memories by meaning, not just keywords.
- **Timeline Logging:** Chronologically track all memory events and updates.
- **Graph Relationships:** Model entities, relationships, and memory links.
- **LLM Summarization:** Summarize and reconcile memories with an LLM.
- **Conflict Handling:** Detect, log, and resolve version conflicts.
- **Cross-Store Consistency:** Ensure all memories are synchronized across stores.
- **Performance at Scale:** Efficient handling of batch inserts and queries.

## ‚ö° Async Features

MemoSynth-Lite is **fully asynchronous** and leverages Python‚Äôs `async`/`await` syntax and the `asyncio` library for high-performance, concurrent operations.

- **All core APIs are async:**  
  Functions such as `write_and_sync_memory`, `query_memory`, `update_memory`, and graph/timeline operations are defined with `async def` and must be called with `await`.

- **Concurrent multi-store writes:**  
  When saving a memory, the system writes to Qdrant, DuckDB, and Neo4j concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, ensuring fast and reliable syncing across stores.

- **Async database clients:**  
  The project uses `AsyncQdrantClient` and `AsyncGraphDatabase` for non-blocking database access.

- **Scalable and responsive:**  
  Async design allows the system to handle multiple memory operations in parallel, making it suitable for agent workflows and future production scaling.

### How to use async APIs

**In a Jupyter notebook, prefix calls with `await`:**
```python
await write_and_sync_memory(memory)
results = await query_memory("What are Q2 risks?")
```

**In a script, use `asyncio.run()`:**
```python
import asyncio
asyncio.run(write_and_sync_memory(memory))
```

> **Note:**  
> If you are new to async Python, see the [asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) for details and examples.

## üîÑ Memory Workflow

1. **Memory Creation:**  
   - A new memory is created with metadata (ID, summary, tags, source, timestamps, etc.).

2. **Vector Storage (Qdrant):**  
   - The memory summary is embedded as a vector and stored in Qdrant for semantic search.

3. **Timeline Logging (DuckDB):**  
   - The memory is logged in DuckDB with a timestamp and version.
   - A primary key constraint prevents Duplicate IDs.

4. **Entity & Relationship Extraction (Neo4j):**  
   - Entities and relationships are extracted from the summary using an LLM.
   - Entities are stored as `Entity` nodes; relationships are created between them.
   - The memory is linked to its entities in the graph.

5. **Memory Update:**  
   - Updates increment the version if no conflict; conflicting updates are logged in DuckDB.

6. **Semantic Search:**  
   - Queries are embedded and used to retrieve the most relevant memories from Qdrant, re-ranked by recency and confidence.

7. **Summarization & Diff:**  
   - The LLM can summarize all memories.
   - Any two memories can be compared (`diff`) or reconciled (`resolve`) using vector similarity and LLM output.

8. **Cross-Store Consistency Check:**  
   - The system checks that all memories are present in Qdrant, DuckDB, and Neo4j.


## üìù Memory Schema

A "memory" is a structured Python dict with rich metadata:

```python
example_memory = {
    "id": "m-001",
    "project": "demo_project",
    "agent": "doc_bot",
    "summary": "Client asked about margin drop in Q2.",
    "type": "insight",
    "tags": ["finance", "Q2", "risk"],
    "source": "Earnings_Report_Q2.pdf",
    "author": "doc_bot",
    "created_at": "2025-06-19",
    "version": 1,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "visibility": "project",
    "sensitivity": "medium"
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è APIs

## üé¨ Demo Walkthrough

The main demo is in `notebook/demo.ipynb`.  
**Each run resets all stores for reproducibility.**

### 1. Environment Reset

All data stores (Qdrant, Neo4j, DuckDB) are cleared at the start.

### 2. Memory Creation & Storage

Three sample memories are defined and written to all stores.

![Memory Storage](images/Shot_11.png)


### 3. Timeline Logging

Memories are logged to DuckDB with timestamps and versioning.  
No duplicates are allowed.

![Timeline Logging](images/Shot_3.png)


### 4. Graph Relationships

Entities and relationships are extracted from memory summaries and stored in Neo4j.

### 5. Semantic Search

Semantic queries return relevant memories, re-ranked by recency and confidence.

![Query Output](images/Shot_5.png)


### 6. Summarization (LLM)

All memories are summarized using an LLM.  
**LLM output is automatically cleaned and repaired using the `json-repair` library to handle malformed JSON.**

![Summary Output](images/Shot_6.png)


### 7. Diff and Resolve (LLM)

Given memories are checked for differences, and their difference is resolved and reconciled using an LLM.

![Resolve Output](images/Shot_7.png)


### 8. Conflict Handling

Memory updates with conflicting versions are detected and logged.  
Conflict logs are stored in DuckDB for auditability.

![Memory Update/Conflict Output](images/Shot_9.png)


### 9. Cross-Store Consistency

Checks that all memories are present in Qdrant, DuckDB, and Neo4j.

### 10. Performance Test

Batch insertion and query timing are measured to demonstrate scalability.

## üí° Design Decisions & Best Practices

- **Three-Store Architecture:** Enables flexible, robust memory management for LLM agents ([see discussion](https://memgraph.com/blog/integrating-vector-and-graph-databases-gen-ai-llms)).
- **LLM JSON Cleaning:** Uses `json-repair` to robustly handle malformed LLM output.
- **Asynchronous Design:** All core APIs and database operations are fully asynchronous (`async`/`await`), enabling concurrent writes and reads to Qdrant, DuckDB, and Neo4j. This ensures non-blocking, scalable performance and smooth integration with agent workflows or high-throughput applications.
- **Conflict Handling:** Implements optimistic concurrency via versioning and detailed conflict logs.
- **Entity Segregation:** Distinguishes between `Memory` and `Entity` nodes in Neo4j for clarity.
- **Cross-Store Consistency:** Regular checks ensure no memory is lost or out of sync.


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Qdrant/Neo4j not running:** Ensure both Docker containers are up before running the notebook.
- **LLM JSON errors:** If you see "JSON extraction failed," check that `json-repair` is installed and imported.
- **Missing outputs:** Rerun all cells from top to bottom after resetting the state.

## üöß Future Improvements

- Add more advanced entity and relationship extraction.
- Integrate with real LLM APIs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).
- Add a user interface for non-technical users.
- Visualize the graph interactively in the notebook.
- Add authentication and access control.
